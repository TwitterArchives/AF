It was clear to me then that there was something disturbing about Disney.   It took my gf 2 years since then to see what I saw, so now she's more considerate on our Disney World saturdays <!--1559270836497956864-->

It's easy to make fun of these folks, but when you talk to them in person, you'll find that they just need gas money to visit their mothers who are in critical condition. <!--1559211831410966531-->

He seemed genuinely concerned. What the heck? It's just Saturday night party time. What, I can't let loose? Let me guess, toxic masculinity 🙄 <!--1558607627499851777-->
* [14 August 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220814001339/https://twitter.com/AmPeopleUnion/status/1558607468707602433): So my wife just had a mental breakdown. Every week when I get home from Saturday night Applebee's happy hour with the boys, I like to play cheeseburgers in paradise for her and I to dance to because it's our song. She just broke down screaming and crying. <!--1558607468707602433-->

It's democracy. Ukraine is sovereign and its people should decide whether or not to join NATO. Biden sent billions to protect our right to choose what our governments do. You have no right to complain <!--1558499732288307200-->

Plus you're gonna end up will all kinds of viruses on your computer with this cozy nonsense. You kids are out of line <!--1558474176113016833-->

This day keeps getting better. 🙃 Locking myself in my room for their sake.   I swear this family doesn't appreciate all the hard work I do running APU. All I can do is scream into my pillow and punch the bed. Assholes!!! <!--1558463670262370306-->
* [13 August 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220813151451/https://twitter.com/AmPeopleUnion/status/1558458153754365952): I appreciate this person agreeing with me politically, but telling me how to raise my son is borderline hitler youth behavior. The irony is this made me more angry, which accomplishes the opposite of what they/them suggests. My wife picked me up my Frappuccino so I'm calming down <!--1558458153754365952-->
* [13 August 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220813031715/https://twitter.com/AmPeopleUnion/status/1558252204758376448): I doubt it. This guy's show doesn't seem like a parody. I flagged him on cozy though so his show won't last for long. Mess with APU and you get the stinger. <!--1558252204758376448-->

He thinks he can just say whatever he wants. He can't be doing that, that's crazy! Trying to brainwash my son. These people are probably globalist spies. We teach the constitution in this household. <!--1558226161351774209-->
* [12 August 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220812221458/https://twitter.com/AmPeopleUnion/status/1558215153136635908): Are you refering to Bill's book? He has nothing to do with Hitler or his young adult novels. Bill O'Reilly used to be a staple in our home, but Hannity has taken his mantle in a hip new Hannity new-wave modern style that combines the retro style of Bill, with a Hannity twist. <!--1558215153136635908-->
* [12 August 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220813012051/https://twitter.com/AmPeopleUnion/status/1558209746930470918): He's so fucking grounded. Excuse my french but we're a good American family, and we don't tolerate this over the top stuff. This stuff is just over the top. <!--1558209746930470918-->

I kicked the wall with my new work shoes I just got at Ross over the weekend. Hurt my big toe pretty bad though. Hope I didn't break it. Having my son stop at the store on the way back to pick up some Motrin. <!--1558209089422987264-->

* [12 August 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220812232227/https://twitter.com/AmPeopleUnion/status/1558197919957778432): Got home from an APU meeting, and caught my zoomer son watching Dalton Clodfelter on this cozy thing just now. I literally went beast and did serious damage to his wall.   He had the nerve to tell me to grow up. He's at Home Depot now, but we're going to have a serious talk later <!--1558197919957778432-->
* [12 August 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220812200623/https://twitter.com/AmPeopleUnion/status/1558182960649625603): Yeah but the great awakening is happening, and my encounter at Whole Foods opened my eyes to this. <!--1558182960649625603-->

You people just conveniently bring up the nurture argument when POC have this over you.  Check your privilege. <!--1558143692329951232-->
* [12 August 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220812172524/https://twitter.com/AmPeopleUnion/status/1558142308264075265): The data suggests POC are more gay. To all the homophobes out there, this behavior has nothing to do with their upbringing in this culture.   They were born this way at a higher percentage than whites, and that's something they'll be proud of, because being gay is cool. 🏳️‍🌈✊🏿💉 <!--1558142308264075265-->

Don't let your coworkers shame you out of doing it in your workplace.   That's your right. If there's no flag, say it at them, and fill them with hope for this nation. 🇺🇲 <!--1558098091219484674-->

We got an email from http://quikfollowbots.com telling us we needed to resend our info due to an error, and they must have shared it around or something.   Lol like what the heck do we do? 😅 <!--1557837986766770176-->

His slave trading ancestry has nothing to do with this, and he didn't choose to be born. #UnbanHunter <!--1557813983339577349-->

This morning in the breakroom, he had his coffee mug perfectly balanced, hanging off the edge of the table. He looked over at our other intern's safely placed coffee mug, and grinned. <!--1557809195109474304-->

The only downside is the constant piano playing in the background, the Arabic subtitles, and it cutting back and forth to a zoomed in dutch angle. <!--1557793609818177540-->

We put our asses on the line and get nothing in return.   Now we know what Harriet Tubman must have felt, but even she didn't have to deal with the cruelty of the internet. <!--1557445057103503363-->

Then he asks me what caused reality itself to be. The "first mover" he says. Uh what?    Literally Big Bang Theory is the first thing.

It would break our hearts to see Lorde or TayTay in that timeline, but it's disgusting to think that they'd slaughter billions of jews if their careers didn't pan out.

APU supports the merciless army of mug club members.   When the regime begs us for mercy, we'll tell them they'll have to beg Louder with Crowder. #darkmerchera <!--1557415067968311296-->

My wife does, but I'm seeing a doctor soon so I'm hoping that will resolve the issue. We're mug club members and watch his show every morning before she goes to work. <!--1557116607310225410-->

The regime is probably panicking as we speak.   Literally the most canceled man on the internet, and he's still destroying libs on every platform. Only Steven could do that.
