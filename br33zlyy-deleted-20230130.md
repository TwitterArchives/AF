I'm actually curious. I want to take a zoological approach to this, like a scientist studying the behavior of chimpanzees in their natural environment <!--1537146214348627969-->

It's a little creepy. I'm sure you can agree if you stepped back. Do you really want Groypers to have meaningless premarital sex? Is that something you really want? Why?? <!--1537136913618026501-->

Preach what the right already knows. Sell out to Israel lobby. Reject Jesus and Christianity. Appeal to right wing's craving to be accepted. Attack effective dissident movements. Promote movements of no consequence. Cash out. <!--1537116129352732677-->

Our country is dying, and our "representatives" will attempt to feed off our desperation. AF stands against all of them <!--1537100994076721154-->

He miscalculated its importance and our priorities <!--1537099778621939714-->
