But someone who slaughtered two of their babies shouldn’t be leading anything.   Women shouldn’t be leading anyway but that’s a separate issue. https://twitter.com/reactionarymay/status/1537166801687166982 <!--1537184154537934850-->

I’m aware there are NO masses that go by sacrosanctum concilium. Ive been to some that are reverent. But for the most part I think the TLM is more nourishing to the faith than the vast majority of NO’s. Especially important I think if you have kids. <!--1537076047648374784-->

I’m talking about the way the liturgy is performed. One is clearly more reverent. I’m not a TLM supremicist. But it is objectively a more fittting liturgy. <!--1537043071321395202-->
