He's also knowledgeable of what he's talking about. He's definitely one of the best right-wing debaters right now. It's pretty clear he won.

Which good for him.  But it doesn't make sense for these 2 to box.  It would make more sense for another political e-celeb to fight Warski. <!--1536956720278343680-->
