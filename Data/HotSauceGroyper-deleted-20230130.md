He's not a native, he's an abomination <!--1543500976249679872-->

No setup, no punchline. Why is he praised? Jim Jeffries for example, covers the same libshit material but he's funny and I respect him for that at least, even though he's factually wrong. <!--1543364606776578048-->

Dude talks about "the pain of his people" when he looks 25-50% non-white MAX. And screaming at white lib girls is always a good thing.  This is GREAT <!--1543357371124133888-->
