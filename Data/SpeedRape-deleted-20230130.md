The onus is on you to pitch it and you did a bad job. You’re suggesting we flip boxing division criteria on its head just so women can get destroyed by male boxers because…..trans rights? Like bruh <!--1505505669629333515-->
* [20 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220320112343/https://twitter.com/SpeedRape/status/1505505235988623362): Your idea is dumb and doesn’t even deserve a brick wall’s argument. <!--1505505235988623362-->
* [20 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220320112309/https://twitter.com/SpeedRape/status/1505505111958855682): The only analysis we need here is real life. Women aren’t as good at boxing. Go watch boxing. You’ll see. <!--1505505111958855682-->
* [20 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220320112459/https://twitter.com/SpeedRape/status/1505504861810577414): Because I am right. Find me a highlight of a woman boxing against someone where she performs like any of the boxers i named. I’ll wait. It’s funny too because she would be competing against lesser talent so it should be easier for her. <!--1505504861810577414-->
* [20 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220320112138/https://twitter.com/SpeedRape/status/1505504556544937986): In the context of this twitter exchange, no i dont care. There’s no need to flesh out a science based argument when you can just look over there at the world of boxing and see how dumb your idea was. <!--1505504556544937986-->
* [20 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220320111959/https://twitter.com/SpeedRape/status/1505504259902775300): My argument is women are not as good at boxing as men. Spend all the time you want pondering about this, but to try and integrate women into men’s boxing would be a blood bath! I’m actually all for it. <!--1505504259902775300-->
* [20 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220320112014/https://twitter.com/SpeedRape/status/1505504065396084738): You’re trying to hard to have to cringe reddit argument here. Statistics, biology, muscle tissue. I don’t care. I’m simply telling you the reality of the situation. You suggested women could compete with men in boxing. That is hilariously wrong. <!--1505504065396084738-->
* [20 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220320111711/https://twitter.com/SpeedRape/status/1505503574201090054): I never said that either. You’re stawmanning! Strawmanning!! <!--1505503574201090054-->
* [20 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220320111622/https://twitter.com/SpeedRape/status/1505503455040974850): Cope + sneed. That’s entirely irrelevant. The point is even with the same exact access to training a woman has never showcased skills comparable to high level men’s boxing. <!--1505503455040974850-->
* [20 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220320111458/https://twitter.com/SpeedRape/status/1505502976932302848): you’re getting mad at arguments i never made. I’m simply acknowledging the reality that women aren’t as good at boxing as men. Simple as. <!--1505502976932302848-->
* [20 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220320111301/https://twitter.com/SpeedRape/status/1505502413326794757): Idk what their problem is. Again your issue is with reality, not me. You can look up highlight reels of Roy Jones Jr or Prince Naseem and i promise you you’ll never find a video of women fighting like them. <!--1505502413326794757-->
* [20 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220320111043/https://twitter.com/SpeedRape/status/1505502062817288192): I never made that claim. I simply said men are better at boxing than women. The women could even have more muscle mass and  the men would win. <!--1505502062817288192-->
* [20 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220320111010/https://twitter.com/SpeedRape/status/1505501897897164803): The issue is learned skill, but not in the sense you mean. Women can’t learn the skills the way men can. They have the same access and oftentimes literally train with men at the same camps. You’re making up fan fiction now about inaccessibility of training. Cope. <!--1505501897897164803-->
* [20 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220320110534/https://twitter.com/SpeedRape/status/1505500652763500552): yeah maybe. The proof here is in reality. The fact that a female boxer never once in history displayed comparable talent or skill to their male counterparts at the highest level. I’m begging you to find me a female fighter that could move like lomachenko. It doesn’t exist. <!--1505500652763500552-->
* [20 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220320110056/https://twitter.com/SpeedRape/status/1505499555244220416): The fact that you picked boxing of all sports to suggest this nonsense idea is so laughable to me. <!--1505499555244220416-->
* [20 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220320105945/https://twitter.com/SpeedRape/status/1505499329632653316): @Callie_UwU @WeedinMyGarden6 @ghouletteclover @Gaslightbossman @MylesLucks Men are physically superior, especially at boxing. They’ve done freak show bouts like this in Muay Thai. World class female fighters get rekt by amateur males (who are much smaller btw). Again, get in touch with reality. <!--1505499329632653316-->
* [20 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220320105509/https://twitter.com/SpeedRape/status/1505498116681838597): >a different boxing league it’s not about leagues. It’s about skill levels. Women wouldn’t come close to sniffing the strap in any weight class if they had to compete with men. It’s a laughable idea. <!--1505498116681838597-->
* [20 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220320105340/https://twitter.com/SpeedRape/status/1505497798699012096): @Callie_UwU @WeedinMyGarden6 @ghouletteclover @Gaslightbossman @MylesLucks It doesn’t matter. The point is they wouldn’t be competitive against men. Suggesting you eliminate gender divisions from sport in favor of gender neutral body mass divisions is ludicrous. <!--1505497798699012096-->
* [20 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220320105250/https://twitter.com/SpeedRape/status/1505497414936973316): >muh biology journals There isn’t a woman alive who wouldn’t look like an uncoordinated mess against someone like Terence Crawford. That’s including ones that potentially have more muscle mass. Get in touch with reality, bro bro. <!--1505497414936973316-->
