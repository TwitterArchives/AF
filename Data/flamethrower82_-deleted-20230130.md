He's been playing a good little Republican lately. I hope this just means he's winding down his contract with @FoxNews. <!--1560532585654226944-->

Meekness means to know your place. If people don't respect you, cut them off. If people can agree to disagree and remain friends, they're winners. Learn to share the world, people. Most get 80-120yrs. Use it wisely. <!--1560531680477286400-->

I've seen pastors kicked out for preaching about abortion, homosexuality, etc. I stick up for those pastors as long as their preaching is honest. Church elders don't like being questioned. <!--1560530638737997824-->

I think they had a secret crush? <!--1560529915803570177-->

Why do people have to be so entitled? <!--1560529358426718208-->
* [19 August 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220819081247/https://twitter.com/flamethrower82_/status/1560528990603022338): The top reason Christians shunned me was: 1. they felt it was my God given duty to get married and have kids. I didn't want that in my 20s 2. I wouldn't shun secular music 3. I sympathize with and don't hate non Christians 4. I listened to "devil's music" and hung out with goths <!--1560528990603022338-->

On one hand, I was very disliked up to my 20s because I was looked at as a prude. On the other side, "Christians" didn't like that I didn't fit the traditional mold, so they shunned me. Damned if I do, damned if I don't. <!--1560527822275452928-->

I hope if you win your election, that we can trust that you'll take that advice and encourage states to do the same. Freedom is always one generation away - and in some cases one government administration away from being lost. <!--1560515578321899521-->

First the capitol building, now the FBI. Why not just wall off the whole city like they did in Hunger Games and Divergent? <!--1560463694278135809-->
* [19 August 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220819060946/https://twitter.com/flamethrower82_/status/1560457958223396865): That's where we really need to make the case for why even if there is a federal law (HIPAA and controlled substance regulation), there still needs to be laws on the books in the state in case the federal government decides to repeal, change, or contradict those laws. <!--1560457958223396865-->

They look at it like "there's already a federal law in place, why is it our problem?" That law could be changed tomorrow, and the #10A grants the states the right to override the federal government. <!--1560456795486814210-->

I know it feels strange trusting people you only know by an anonymous name, but people get it done. <!--1560445465090527233-->

The FBI sure thinks a lot of people are terrorists. The horrible part is that once you're branded a terrorist, the government thinks that you're no longer a US citizen worthy of Constitutional rights. <!--1560307643339636737-->

Also, I don't think content being "boring" is an excuse for not being willing to listen. Some people don't like to be challenged, and they're the ones we need to confront the most. <!--1560299745201070081-->

Meme warfare has worked well because it has a funny element. Maybe we need to make some funny and entertaining content to wake people up. <!--1560291155652317184-->

We're doing the work they don't have the time to do out of sheer love for our country, and they don't want to hear it. <!--1560283000851632130-->

Just because someone makes good speeches (aka Obama and Trump) doesn't mean he/she is a good candidate. So we're back to square one: the voters don't care. <!--1560280783864168448-->

Both parties play the game - it's a game of how quickly they can gain wealth and influence. They work for the corporations and political parties that sponsor them. You don't have to like @RepBoebert to agree with the idea. If they can't read it, neither can we. <!--1560274516953436160-->

It would be a stop-gap measure to give the people some power of representation back. Europe and Australia use this system. basically, you pick 1st-xth choice of candidates. I would like to abolish parties entirely but this could give some power back. <!--1560273654562164736-->

You can live out the "Imagine" (John Lennon) fantasy all you like. Abolish all money and split the labor. Let's see how long your little commune lasts.

That should alarm people that almost the entire Congress opposes it. I wish they would re-read our founding documents and take proctored tests too annually. <!--1560270902100500484-->

Do you really believe Vietnam-era men are writing today's laws? I believe their corporate sponsors write bills. <!--1560270015118868480-->

You're just a statistic to them. That's what most people don't understand. (4/x) <!--1560269420316225538-->
