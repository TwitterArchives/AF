(Just curious)  I’m not convinced naturalisation is possible on a mass scale. We end up with multiculturalism instead. <!--1559047211723685889-->

I’m not 100% sure what you mean. 2) I don’t care what Scott Morrison says. 3) Why do you like your own tweets? 4) Proof-read your tweets. “If Australians are the going to do their job…” lol <!--1559007315176849409-->

This is especially true considering that the shortages happened in the wake of harsh lockdowns (and the ensuing economic issues)- which we could recover from. <!--1558715750562803713-->
* [13 August 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220813220505/https://twitter.com/BurnerAuzzie/status/1558574791787184128): Australia is our home, not a business. More immigration will continue to disrupt the identity of our country. It’s not good enough to appeal to labour shortages as a justification for this. <!--1558574791787184128-->

Your threshold for who you consider a Zionist is so unbelievably warped that it’s impossible to take seriously. <!--1557479130467549184-->

So the joke just doesn’t connect. Metokur continues to suck at comedy. <!--1553411107410554880-->

The fact that RPG failed so hard in a debate like that just shows how unserious and unintelligent he is. <!--1553340477088612353-->
