Cancer can be used to make money off the dying and can be used as a "natural" way to keep the population down.

No amount of gun roundup or gun laws is going to stop people from obtaining firearms. You're just taking away normal citizens' guns. <!--1529207014903230468-->

MMA "mixed martial arts" wrestling, sambo,judo,BJJ ,these are all martial arts in the art of controlling another human being,and a massive part of the sport <!--1529180912574930946-->

You do not have to submit or strike for grappling to be effective in shutting your opponent down. If I'm keeping you in a shit position and you can't get out of it I'm controlling you, just like how I can control you with striking. <!--1529179089818501122-->

EFFECTIVE GRAPPLING IS WHEN I'M CONTROLLING YOU.  I can submit you or punch you, but I don't have to, I can keep you there against your will if I want and make you tired, make you struggle. <!--1529174023195742208-->

He knew what he saw, what a freaking joke. This won't stop until the UFC can get it's own scoring system or somehow separate from using these commissions. <!--1528575154196037633-->

Being held against the fence or being on your freaking back are not dominant positions. If it's not effective then just stand up or GTFO of the clinch. <!--1528572707675287552-->
