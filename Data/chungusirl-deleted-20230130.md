* [27 July 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220727042214/https://twitter.com/chungusirl/status/1552107338659614722?s=21&t=q6aJ2XAFMTAUwsNs8h9IrQ): In conclusion, the standard narrative of how oil is formed is a marketing ploy. Rockefeller's fingerprints are all over this manipulation. A-biotic theories are more empirically rigorous and intuitive. OPEC is lying to manipulate oil prices and push green energy expenditure. <!--1552107474877984768-->
* [27 July 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220727042214/https://twitter.com/chungusirl/status/1552107338659614722?s=21&t=q6aJ2XAFMTAUwsNs8h9IrQ): Much evidence already exists suggest that oil companies retain gasoline and crude reserves to artificially induce scarcity. OPEC has been accused frequently of market manipulation, as indicated by these graphs. <!--1552107469677088774-->
* [27 July 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220727042214/https://twitter.com/chungusirl/status/1552107338659614722?s=21&t=q6aJ2XAFMTAUwsNs8h9IrQ): To ask such a question, is to answer it. We have established 3 certain facts 1.) A-biotic oil theory is not only tested, but highly replicable 2.) Most researchers outside of the US-EU-Saudi system agree with it 3.) Oil companies and green lobbyists have acted to discredit it. <!--1552107455911383041-->
* [27 July 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220727042214/https://twitter.com/chungusirl/status/1552107338659614722?s=21&t=q6aJ2XAFMTAUwsNs8h9IrQ): It is no suprise then, that the abiogenic theory of petroleum has become the official stance of Russian and Chinese geological research. We are left to wonder then, why are the countries which set the global petrodollar and mass reserves of oil, so quick to "debunk" a-biotic oil? <!--1552107453289967616-->
* [27 July 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220727042214/https://twitter.com/chungusirl/status/1552107338659614722?s=21&t=q6aJ2XAFMTAUwsNs8h9IrQ): While the biotic theory not only rests upon an under-estimation of the amount of oil produced by a-biotic processes, it also relies on a gross under-estimation of exactly how deep oil wells go. Which is why the biotic theory invokes a completely untestable standard of evidence. <!--1552107446834905088-->
* [27 July 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220727042214/https://twitter.com/chungusirl/status/1552107338659614722?s=21&t=q6aJ2XAFMTAUwsNs8h9IrQ): The primary objection that biotic apologists hold to, is that if oil occurs naturally in Earth's upper mantle, it should be far more observable along fault lines.   This argument, however, relies on a massive underestimation of the complexity of earth's tunnel network. <!--1552107440551866371-->
* [27 July 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220727042214/https://twitter.com/chungusirl/status/1552107338659614722?s=21&t=q6aJ2XAFMTAUwsNs8h9IrQ): The conclusion derived by many scientists became apparent. The biogenic theory defies many of our observations. An a-biotic theory, in which petroleum naturally occurs due to heat and pressure in Earth's upper mantle, was rigorously tested and empirically replicated. <!--1552107434935607297-->
* [27 July 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220727042214/https://twitter.com/chungusirl/status/1552107338659614722?s=21&t=q6aJ2XAFMTAUwsNs8h9IrQ): In 2012, Russian researchers tested this hypothesis. Through testing, they discovered that heat-levels approximate to those of earth's upper-mantle, were sufficient to hold hydrocarbons necessary in the formation of petroleum at equilibrium state. An a-biotic explanation arose. <!--1552107433102757889-->
* [27 July 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220727042214/https://twitter.com/chungusirl/status/1552107338659614722?s=21&t=q6aJ2XAFMTAUwsNs8h9IrQ): Recent findings, however, call this theory into question. They also reveal the more nefarious motivations behind its popularization. In 2009, researchers from the Carnegie Institute observed hydrocarbons forming in the upper mantle. They could not estimate how much was present. <!--1552107418376581121-->
* [27 July 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220727042214/https://twitter.com/chungusirl/status/1552107338659614722?s=21&t=q6aJ2XAFMTAUwsNs8h9IrQ): Why was this theory so important to Rockefeller? The consequences of the "biogenic" theory of oil imply a strict scarcity of petroleum. Rockefeller successfully predicted the exponential growth in demand for oil, and recognized the potential in controlling supply. <!--1552107413444050944-->
* [27 July 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220727042214/https://twitter.com/chungusirl/status/1552107338659614722?s=21&t=q6aJ2XAFMTAUwsNs8h9IrQ): It was at this conference, hosted by key Rockefeller associates, that the "biogenic theory of oil" was established. Chemists agreed to form consensus around the hypothesis that oil was an organic substance, generated over tens of millions of years, by compressed organic material. <!--1552107410298327040-->
* [27 July 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220727042214/https://twitter.com/chungusirl/status/1552107338659614722?s=21&t=q6aJ2XAFMTAUwsNs8h9IrQ): Gladstone and Baeyer were given great amounts for research by Rockefeller. Even today, one of the main contributors to the "Gladstone Institutes" is the Rockefeller Foundation. Further, Senatorial documents prove Rockefeller's chief lobbyist, William Shearer was in attendance. <!--1552107402685583361-->

Among them were close associates of Rockefeller such as John Hall Gladstone and Adolf von Baeyer. <!--1552107397585313792-->
* [27 July 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220727042214/https://twitter.com/chungusirl/status/1552107338659614722?s=21&t=q6aJ2XAFMTAUwsNs8h9IrQ): In 1889, Rockefeller pledged $600,000 to found the University of Chicago. He paid particular focus on the department of economics to craft research and policy favorable to his business ventures. On his death bed, he would reflect that it was the "greatest investment I ever made." <!--1552107390471876608-->
* [27 July 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220727042214/https://twitter.com/chungusirl/status/1552107338659614722?s=21&t=q6aJ2XAFMTAUwsNs8h9IrQ): Rockefeller's success can be largely accredited to his forming of a railroad cartel, in which smaller players were priced out of competition for transport. Rockefeller quickly became one of the most powerful men in the world, and put his money to work in the public sphere. <!--1552107380954935297-->
* [27 July 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220727042214/https://twitter.com/chungusirl/status/1552107338659614722?s=21&t=q6aJ2XAFMTAUwsNs8h9IrQ): As the supply for whale-oil based Kerosene fell dramatically, and demand for rock oil increased, refinenement and transportation became the most profitable untapped market. In 1870, John D. Rockefeller founded the most successful oil company of all time, "Standard Oil." <!--1552107369840029696-->
* [27 July 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220727042214/https://twitter.com/chungusirl/status/1552107338659614722?s=21&t=q6aJ2XAFMTAUwsNs8h9IrQ): In 1848, salt miner Samuel Kier discovered the first application of "rock oil" as means producing kerosene (lamp oil). Kier established America's first oil refinery. Edwin Drake would contemporaneously establish America's first oil drill, "Drake's Well" in 1859. <!--1552107359874347008-->

When refined through atmospheric distillation, crude oil is synthesized into gasoline. Gasoline is a highly volatile liquid used for most mechanical combustion. <!--1552107350105804801-->

The answer is not as simple as you might think.   In this thread, we'll investigate the history, science, and politics of the oil industry to uncover what is perhaps the greatest deception ever sold to the American people. <!--1552107338659614722-->
