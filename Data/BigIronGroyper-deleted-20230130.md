Their short 5.56 is 10.5 and their next offering is 16 and then 18.5. but they offer a 10" 300blk and that'd work really well <!--1393544047676039170-->

I wish 5.56 did what 300 blk does at short lengths, but anything under 12.5" has a big ballistic cutoff. I want a shorter more lethal package. Working w/ 16" 556 in my truck blows, from experience. <!--1393543629269086208-->

Good ceramics that are special threat exist (Hesco L210s) and they can do a lot for like $375. I'm still scouting the Hoplite level 4s for reasons previously stayed, but if you've got money, Hesco level 3's and 4's are what SF guys run regularly <!--1393232986670313478-->

That's probably the only one I would sorta trust. I'd never touch AR500, they say all types of shady shit about them putting it thru "in house NIJ certification like tests" which is just a long way of saying it's not verified. Me no likey. <!--1393231457871613955-->

Most steel I don't trust because of spall, and lack of NIJ certification. Keep in mind though, I am an avid follower of TRex arms, so I'm just parroting what I hear guys who buy exclusively Gucci shit say, low key <!--1393230180517359622-->

I got a hookup gun shop who bought like 10 million rounds back I the day, and since everyone's scrambling for 5.56/.223, 9mm, 7.62, etc I get to plink with my Mosin for like 50 cents a round still 🤠 <!--1393229590848581642-->

It's not 2012 anymore and you can have a great budget printer setup in an hour and shipped for 2 hundo.

I saw Reno May running them. NIJ certified ceramics which, all added to your cart, seem to be around the same price as steel when you've got everything.

I try to have enough that I can run any one of my rifles more proficiently should push come to shove. But you don't have to buy all Gucci stuff.

But have you taken a good look at which kit to get after? training stuff? Shot timers? Any chest rigs, belt systems, plate carriers, armor, medical, etc?  Do you own kit as well as guns or just guns? Why or why not? I'm curious 🧐 <!--1393221284599894023-->
