Literally just be attractive, charismatic, go to the gym, and don’t hide yourself from women. Not that difficult. <!--1538146905716412417-->

Teachers try to affirm, and thus celebrate, that which reminds them of themselves. This is why if conservatives want to win, it has to go beyond uprooting the curriculum.   To win, we have to uproot and replace the liberal staff of our institutions <!--1535704335593754624-->
