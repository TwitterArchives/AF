I understand the Sch**l Sh**ter name change cus of deplatforming reasons.  It's cool to grow and change your music, look at Tyler. I just think you should keep the name instead of having to rebrand and have everyone find out again. Plus I like the name. <!--1467350781129109504-->

It does make total sense to get away from something you've never accepted or reject a label someone is falsely giving to you.  I just don't see how changing your name again is going to help. Either way I'll support you, I love your music. <!--1467346578574913537-->

As your music improves even more people will forget about the old music, kinda like what happened to Tyler, The Creator. https://twitter.com/negativexp123/status/1467312669044748293 <!--1467324488610193409-->

I did research, found a claim one of the English VA's said about an old Gainax translation and talked about it, and Dan has added and sorta disputed what she said.  Now I'm just trying to figure everything out. https://twitter.com/VulnePro/status/1429552352265216008 <!--1429555653413163010-->

I totally believe Dan that he made it from scratch, he is credited as such. I know he isn't lying.  Maybe the old script existed and Khara just forgot about it and had Dan do a new one? <!--1429548825451040787-->

But then why wouldn't they let him use the older one and JUST make adjustments to it to improve it?  This would make it easier on him and would speed up the process of getting it finished. <!--1429548824293412866-->

But the second point brings this into question... If there WAS an older, unused translation... why would they pay to make a new one that's almost identical to the old one and Amanda thought it was the same? <!--1429548823282606080-->
