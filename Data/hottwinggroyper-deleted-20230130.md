He's a schizo that made an entire operating system on his own, guided by God in his own estimation, always on the look out for fbi/cia. Maybe crazy but a KING of internet lore. <!--1529345024000925696-->

Nick is a great kid, undeniably generationally talented, probably genius IQ.  Most of what you have a problem with is a generational divide. He's ONLY 23. He has so much growing to do. <!--1529335803775799297-->
