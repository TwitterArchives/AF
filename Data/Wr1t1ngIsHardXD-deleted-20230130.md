I'm sorry you get death threats. I would never advocate for violence. But if saying the n-word is enough to get beat up, you should understand where these people are coming from. <!--1364726168272965632-->

The word was created by a pedophile named John Money who did an experiment where he raped and castrated a young boy and forced his brother to perform sex acts on him, while he took video. <!--1364725879063126017-->

You could just establish a whole set of businesses with yourself as the sole proprietor and laborer. For instance, being a music tutor.   I don't see how this is relevant to the conversation though. <!--1364723881790087177-->

Suicide and other diseases of despair are on the rise.   Also, it's not even close to a half million. Where are the bodies in the streets? Has anyone you know died of Covid?

Corona is only dangerous if you have a complication like asthma, or if you're super old. <!--1364698482506924032-->

Masks and lockdowns do nothing. In fact, doing nothing actually would have been less harmful than the measures we used.   We have the worst death toll because the CDC relaxed their standards to pump up the numbers. <!--1364643824870580224-->

Because of this, the Socialists told the President to cancel the vote, for no other reason than "Spain is now a left-wing country." They didn't contest the actual totals.
