It's not like he knows most of these people, but some choose to take it personally. If you don't see the humor in it, that's fine, but for people to turn against him for that just shows how shallow and insecure they are. <!--1558812545837924353-->

Leftists would cheer it on, and libertarians & closeted progressives (most republicans) would find excuses to undermine the severity of the issue to avoid taking a stand and being labeled extremists. <!--1558147879746805762-->

I'm sure there were plenty of Christian Nazis. That isn't my point. It wasn't a Christian Nationalist movement. <!--1551645071220645889-->
