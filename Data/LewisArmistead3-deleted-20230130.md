Taken per capita, that's even worse than it seems since blacks are just 13% of the population. <!--1530334702015598592-->

It's like an epic movie before film was invented.  If you want to better understand the plot beforehand, there's a great graphic novel that conveys the story quite well.

Kids are especially vulnerable now that you have way more LGBT "parents."  Regardless, it's bad for the kids to not have parents of both sexes. I met an Asian with lesbian parents and she was totally messed up, hated men but still a total ho. <!--1528176000152268801-->

I was actually more sympathetic to Marley at first since I saw them as racial humans fighting monstrous shapeshifters, but flipped bc Paradis is in the same situation as white ppl pic.twitter.com/zVTpQ4m2bD <!--1506770035385135105-->

Better to spend your life building a movement that can change society than just popping out a couple kids.   Vince is a good example of someone who can do both though <!--1504568776653787138-->

It seems like the most successful (high fertility, few people leaving) groups selectively accept technologies that are beneficial without weakening cohesion <!--1499196186552528902-->

This is my favorite video of theirs so far, it's real but it sounds straight out of an anime: https://youtu.be/-qTINs4Sq8A <!--1498216514792484869-->
