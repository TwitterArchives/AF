TRS really out there making a difference with their 20 person protests. Epic  Did you see the conference they put on? They didn't have any senators or congressmen or really anyone of importance but they had a bunch of fat ugly people show up. So cool and epic! <!--1567914146263633920-->

He made a lot of mistakes like his platinum plan  But this is undeniably a good stance for him to take.

He went on and on about reporting him and anyone else that is in anyway negative towards us <!--1566561844977754112-->
* [ 4 September 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220904225956/https://twitter.com/FireRises_/status/1566561469163921408): Yes destiny is a piece of shit and using this to hurt us. That's true I agree üëç. But it doesn't matter, the end result is we lose.  Watch this clip. Sneako now thinks we mass reported him and big tech gave destiny the ammo to use <!--1566561469163921408-->
* [ 4 September 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220904224051/https://twitter.com/FireRises_/status/1566556928628510720): @groyphardaf You are missing the bigger picture. Regardless of why it happens losing sneako would be a major loss for cozy. Especially if cozy starts to get known for mass reporting people <!--1566556928628510720-->
* [ 4 September 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220906085314/https://twitter.com/FireRises_/status/1566556112974798848): Both are important. If we lose sneako it's a bit L. Losing destiny too would suck too <!--1566556112974798848-->
* [ 4 September 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220904225956/https://twitter.com/FireRises_/status/1566561469163921408): That doesn't matter. At all. The reason that sneako doesn't associate with us is irrelevant.   If this screws up Nick's relationship with sneako we lose big time. Regardless of the reason, fair or not <!--1566555583934713856-->
* [ 4 September 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220904225956/https://twitter.com/FireRises_/status/1566561469163921408): Big Tech may have single handedly ruined our chances of Sneako streaming on Cozy. Great job üëè üëç once again big tech causes problems in AF <!--1566547971818196992-->

So they are "ironically" doing it under the guise of a jab at cozytv, when in reality it's insecurity <!--1566532126215876608-->
* [ 4 September 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220906155906/https://twitter.com/FireRises_/status/1566528098257973249): The only correct answer <!--1566528098257973249-->

His music videos "I am a pedophile" and "I kill pedophiles" alone break the rules  ToS is the problem. You should push to change the rules so both Max and Nick Fuentes can be on YouTube. That's the solution <!--1566522231433228288-->

It's like they want AF to stay a fringe cool kids club. Becoming mainstream would mean they aren't unique   But we are in this to win it. Which means making allies not pushing them away if they aren't perfect <!--1566259122755883010-->
* [ 4 September 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220904025211/https://twitter.com/FireRises_/status/1566257641713586176): Why though? He isn't betraying us by associating with metokur or by being friendly with Jaden on a stream. He isn't one of us  What matters is he doesn't lie and attack us. He gives nick a more than fair mini doc and other coverage. He provides us with audiences outside our own <!--1566257641713586176-->
* [ 4 September 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220904012000/https://twitter.com/FireRises_/status/1566234284624470016): I just think it's unfair to hold Michal to the same standards as someone in AF. He's a friend of Nick and AF but has been clear that he isn't a groyper  Still good to have him around because he brings his own kind of content to cozy. All we are doing is pushing him away <!--1566234284624470016-->
* [ 4 September 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220904022606/https://twitter.com/FireRises_/status/1566233417217236992): What did he say. I'm blocked <!--1566233417217236992-->

The adl and the splc would indeed label nick anti Semitic bur I wouldn't.  Also, those quotes out of context. Idk how many times I need to say it <!--1566181850841636870-->

He said no And then said "I'm white and I'm a nationalist but I'm not a white nationalist" <!--1565880741245755393-->

* [ 3 September 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220903025301/https://twitter.com/FireRises_/status/1565858122501013510): That's fine, I'd record them too if only for posterity but don't use those threats on Twitter to defame nick <!--1565858122501013510-->
* [ 3 September 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220903013431/https://twitter.com/FireRises_/status/1565857809920454656): He isn't a neo nazi. He doesn't advocate for anything close to nazim <!--1565857809920454656-->

You have lied through omission to me multiple times. You manipulate and warp facts to slander AF daily so nothing you say is going to be taken seriously <!--1565857656840933376-->

You don't even have proof nick asked someone to dox you.   Obviously there are going to be people in any group that will do shit like that but nick isn't responsible for everyone that calls themselves a groyper <!--1565850518181666816-->
