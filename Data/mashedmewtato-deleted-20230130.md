* [ 2 June 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220602214440/https://twitter.com/MashedMewtato/status/1532478135341572115): I hate when people act like science is inherently an opposing force to religion. Nothing has convinced with more certainty of God's existence than the objective, observable realities of cosmology. <!--1532478135341572115-->
* [ 2 June 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220602214243/https://twitter.com/MashedMewtato/status/1532477163395506204): Why do you think almost every human being, since the beginning of time, has felt such an irrational dissatisfaction? <!--1532477163395506204-->
* [ 2 June 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220602213750/https://twitter.com/MashedMewtato/status/1532476488741707776): No, the prevailing model suggests that everything, including the four fundamental forces of nature (of which gravity is one) came about spontaneously from a single point. The model also shows all four forces being unified as one "superforce" in the very early Universe. <!--1532476488741707776-->
* [ 2 June 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220602213451/https://twitter.com/MashedMewtato/status/1532475728259866642): Real. Everything we know about the laws of of physics points to this. It makes far more sense than "Everything spontaneously came from nothing at all, and there is and always has been nothing beyond the universe." People just don't even want to begin to go there though. <!--1532475728259866642-->
* [ 2 June 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220602213048/https://twitter.com/MashedMewtato/status/1532474686780612608): Well it is a theory, since there's zero way of proving it with certianty, but there is extensive evidence of it, and it lines up with all of our observations and analysis of the Universe. In my opinion though, it affirms the idea of a creator more than almost anything could. <!--1532474686780612608-->

The current explanation is that everything, incl time, came from nothing. Everything, incl time was created spontaneously from one, infinitely small point. No one can explain what triggered the creation of everything. <!--1532473732446445568-->

That is part of the model itself.  This implies something, outside of and beyond everything in the Universe, which triggered such a process. <!--1532470552887283712-->

The thought of ceasing to exist in any form and not even being able to think of/conceptualize that reality has kept me up many nights. <!--1532456040687714334-->

If I think too much or too deeply about it, the thought of nothing after death makes me spiral into madness. It drives me crazy to even begin to imagine just entirely ceasing to exist in any form. <!--1532444804055015424-->

You don't even get to think, to be, to experience anything, even if it's torturous. You're just gone, nothing, you never really were anything. It honestly drives me crazy just thinking about it. <!--1532443179777245210-->

At least in hell, you still have your mind, you still exist and you still can think and be, even if it's torturous. The concept of nothingness and just ceasing to exist entirely shakes me to my very core. <!--1532442621683154964-->

To me, the prospect of their being nothing after death is more terrifying to think about as it's not only unimaginable, but says we really are just atoms. But in terms of the actual despair you would feel, ofc hell would be worse. <!--1532440717104128000-->
