To turn and do the motions that he did when he knows he's unarmed and he's already fired at them makes no sense. <!--1543999646598660101-->

They waited till he turned looking like he was about to draw a pistol. <!--1543999001548185601-->

That the officers had multiple chances to mag dump him in the vehicle or while running away and chose not to. Until he turned, took a shooter stance, and grabbed his waist. It's still confuses me as to why he turned. <!--1543998225710972928-->

That is a clear and present danger to you as an officer because you don't have X-ray vision you don't know if he has a gun or not. <!--1543996862818050052-->

Again, you continue to ignore portions of the case to fit your narrative and worldview, which is fine, millions of you do it, but it doesn't make you look intelligent. You sound upset lol <!--1543994234126143490-->

Chambers at crematoria 2 and 3, were located underground, while those at crematoria 4 and 5 stood at ground level. Before these, they used provisional chambers 800-1200. <!--1543912745795571712-->

The math done that's a little over 21 thousand a month with a camp capacity of 60 thousand. <!--1543906717293056002-->

They controlled 44,000 ghettos/ camps during that time and they had quotas. <!--1543904501937176578-->

Zyklon B only takes 20 minutes to kill, you just have to cram in as many as you can, which they did. Then ensure it's somewhat air-tight (not entirely sealed), which they did to the best of their ability. <!--1543900240021004288-->

Now doing it cheaply is what the Nazis tried to perfect. The Soviets did as well, but they were on the winning team so you all have to look the other way lol. The ideologies were different too, the Soviets killed to defend Communism <!--1543897544232665092-->

The Japanese killed 6 million in China. Continuing including all occupied territories in the Pacific that number jumps to over 10 million. <!--1543894946062782464-->

But they're still causing the same issue the other stimulus did. You're pumping money into an economy that can not meet the demand which WILL cause more inflation lol. <!--1543879752980856838-->

Put it towards infrastructure or, maybe, idk, some solution to your state's horrible homeless problem like housing. The state could contract that work and create jobs as well. <!--1543875909098283008-->

I'm fine with it when the demand can be met and you won't see a rise in price.  But all this will do is cause the same effect as the federal stimulus did. <!--1543874921893355522-->
