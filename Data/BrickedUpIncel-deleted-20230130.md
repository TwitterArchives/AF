* [25 April 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220425021220/https://twitter.com/BrickedUpIncel/status/1518412480615268352): sorry boss <!--1518412480615268352-->
* [25 April 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220425013638/https://twitter.com/BrickedUpIncel/status/1518403457102888963): Yes, but I would argue the side opposite to Ralph is firmly hell bent on destroying his career and has been before the strike. I don’t see the distinction between the behavior on both sides. They’re trying to level each other. <!--1518403457102888963-->
* [25 April 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220425004740/https://twitter.com/BrickedUpIncel/status/1518391179569737728): I agree the drama can be funny but to go back to my original point, to draw the code of honor line at Flem getting DMCA’d is silly. Him seething and Ralph mocking him was funny too. Not saying you personally drew this line, but many have, which is was the core issue. <!--1518391179569737728-->

You may be right. I think PPP and Warski would hype up every breath he takes regardless of how he reacted, though. Idk enough about Flam but they’re all just rolling the mud together at this point. <!--1518384508030099456-->
* [24 April 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220424235413/https://twitter.com/BrickedUpIncel/status/1518377655401422849): I don’t know if the Ralph lore is true or not. I don’t know all of it. And I admit Ralph has done some stupid stuff. What’s clear though is the gloves have been off on both sides for a while. Who started it is a different conversation. <!--1518377655401422849-->
* [24 April 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220424233147/https://twitter.com/BrickedUpIncel/status/1518372073848066050): “It’s just laughing bro” Yeah, or libel and character assassination. Which is also an attemp at career ruination. <!--1518372073848066050-->
* [24 April 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220424230818/https://twitter.com/BrickedUpIncel/status/1518366194184695808): Again this is deflection, and not an argument. It’s not addressing the actual issue. I’ve heard Flem on this and he’s not just laughing at Ralph’s thin skin. He’s acting like a DMCA is crossing a moral line. <!--1518366194184695808-->
* [24 April 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220424225801/https://twitter.com/BrickedUpIncel/status/1518363565077450752): It has been about moral grandstanding though. Maybe not from you personally but tons of people are taking issue specifically with reporting. Everything else is irrelevant to the debate. <!--1518363565077450752-->
* [24 April 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220424223002/https://twitter.com/BrickedUpIncel/status/1518356442113314817): You can say it’s short sighted and petty, whatever. My only point is it’s not morally objectionable compared to all the other back and forth going on, yet it raised a particularly high amount of moral grandstanding as if it was some line crossed or code of honor broken. <!--1518356442113314817-->
* [24 April 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220424221800/https://twitter.com/BrickedUpIncel/status/1518353514921086988): If someone steals from someone then they report arson, would you only condemn the false report and not the initial theft? I would imagine in Ralph’s case he used a DMCA because it’s more effective. <!--1518353514921086988-->
* [24 April 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220424213833/https://twitter.com/BrickedUpIncel/status/1518343522553896962): Again, whether or not you think it’s slander is irrelevant. I’m asking if it’s ok to report someone for slander. Does it matter if it’s copyright or a TOS strike? If someone is slandering you it’s below the belt, so why is reporting wrong? Your analogy is completely disingenuous. <!--1518343522553896962-->
* [24 April 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220424213216/https://twitter.com/BrickedUpIncel/status/1518341914835271685): https://twitter.com/Styx666Official/status/1518312753882181632  pic.twitter.com/cv58k6spzl <!--1518341914835271685-->
* [24 April 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220424202151/https://twitter.com/BrickedUpIncel/status/1518324280274079744): I’m asking a question. Is reporting ok if it’s slander? You’re missing the point about Flem. It’s to show this moral grandstanding about reporting is disingenuous. I don’t think he’s wrong for encouraging that. <!--1518324280274079744-->
* [24 April 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220424194602/https://twitter.com/BrickedUpIncel/status/1518315125593288707): So now the argument is whether or not you believe it. So flagging is not always wrong. It’s ok if it’s slander? Ralph thinks it is. But whether or not the things are true is a different argument. Also, again, there’s video of Flam encouraging reporting & it’s not for slander. <!--1518315125593288707-->
* [24 April 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220424103611/https://twitter.com/BrickedUpIncel/status/1518176913948389376): pic.twitter.com/vH9Mr8LP0n <!--1518176913948389376-->

In the case of Ralph vs Flam, here’s a video of Flam encouraging people to report JF https://twitter.com/TheRalphRetort/status/1517951940541431808?s=20&t=pb6iyf6QpfIObCvwlh64gQ <!--1518133468642910208-->

What is the actual argument for flagging being morally wrong, more so than other forms of life or career ruination? <!--1518131644053565440-->
* [24 April 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220424073344/https://twitter.com/BrickedUpIncel/status/1518130856388444161): It’s not damage control, it’s just a fact. The closest thing Metokur gave to an argument was “ur gay sour grapes.” Like what was his position beyond that on the flagging issue? <!--1518130856388444161-->
* [24 April 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220424072008/https://twitter.com/BrickedUpIncel/status/1518127554422575104): By debate do you mean Metokur deflecting for two hours with shitty jokes and refusing to actually engage with any real argument? <!--1518127554422575104-->
* [24 April 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220424071420/https://twitter.com/BrickedUpIncel/status/1518126018564923393): Ralph is already vindicated <!--1518126018564923393-->

He has no idea either. This is divine justice <!--1516189495405723648-->

He debates libertarians like Dave Smith about this. He views institutional power as like a weapon that the left is in control of that the RW needs to seize. He never argues for absolute free speech. <!--1516187642349723652-->

And notice how Nick was able to have a civil conversation with the other guy who clearly disagreed with him. The jangles guy was just seething and disruptive. <!--1515923114391187458-->

Flam can’t hide behind fake dismissive laughter with Nick when he scrutinizes how gay all Flam’s points are. He walks back like 90% of it and just says “well Ralph should just laugh when we attack him durrrrr” <!--1515922405482536965-->
