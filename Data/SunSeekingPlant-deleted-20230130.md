They left it open to interpretation so ultimately the war is driven by the bias and ego of Rhaenyra and Alicent. It fits the idea in the books that its written by an unreliable narrator. <!--1579330329156124672-->

The fact that you even need "positivity" kind of reveals your state of mind. <!--1567652064112558080-->
* [ 7 September 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220907230742/https://twitter.com/SunSeekingPlant/status/1567650131020812288): "Standing up for liberty and equity" isn't what defines a "Hero". You should go back to English class. <!--1567650131020812288-->

* [ 7 September 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220908003251/https://twitter.com/SunSeekingPlant/status/1567581802780565506): Every person who feels the need to to countersignal egoistic bigotry has to lie to themselves is some way. They are emotionally reactive before the intellectual curiosity has even begun. And they always end up being more stupid as a result. <!--1567581805255204864-->
* [ 7 September 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220908003251/https://twitter.com/SunSeekingPlant/status/1567581802780565506): Great right wing intellectuals say "we're anti left, but we're not crude racists or sexists- that's anti intellectual and ignoble." I agree with that, but in this day and age, it's way better to approach the intellectual arena from that perspective than the opposite. <!--1567581802780565506-->
* [ 7 September 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220908035628/https://twitter.com/SunSeekingPlant/status/1567571521161273344): Tough guy in a baseball cap and covered in tatoos: "We can learn a lot from our bisexual brothers. A lot of the best rappers are like that." <!--1567577704903344131-->

Being gross and neurotic is a type of identity. The same applies to these bougie men. <!--1567577133035257857-->
* [ 7 September 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220908035628/https://twitter.com/SunSeekingPlant/status/1567571521161273344): Grown men going on and on about "relationships". Makes me sick to my stomach. It sounds SO GAY. <!--1567575803658964999-->

He's clearly a nihilist but he continues to act like a moralist simply out of habit and self indulgence. Its veering off into nothing, but he still lies to himself about the seriousness of his mission. <!--1567574518075367424-->

Nick completely, persuasively ridicules his disgusting lifestyle without being a moral f*g about it. Destiny's bougie, feminine, hyper sexual taste is so life denying and suffocating. <!--1567571521161273344-->
* [ 7 September 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220907202218/https://twitter.com/SunSeekingPlant/status/1567554878825701380): You live in fear of people making you look bad. <!--1567554878825701380-->

The black elf is occupying the city to make sure the white humans don't become evil again. He falls in love with a single mom with a mixed race kid. <!--1567550996145913856-->
* [ 7 September 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220907162429/https://twitter.com/SunSeekingPlant/status/1567549376460988418): I like the Game of Thrones morality a lot more than the LotR morality, but I could still recreate it a million times better than this. They turn the holy and sacred into something moralistic and sentimental. It's so crude and plebeian. <!--1567549376460988418-->
* [ 7 September 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220907204720/https://twitter.com/SunSeekingPlant/status/1567550996145913856): I can't get over the terrible writing in The Rings of Power. The elves are supposed to be an aristocratic noble race, but they have no idea what that means so they just desperately try to sound profound. <!--1567547537975906306-->
* [ 7 September 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220907151140/https://twitter.com/SunSeekingPlant/status/1567531051538415617): RT @m0e_almighty: Azula vs Zuko was prime television, this fight was amazing https://t.co/m0DomAtNHw <!--1567531051538415617-->

If @TheOmniLiberal allows his audience to call Nick a Nazi, he will have to label the entire right wing as Nazis- and his entire project fails. People like Charlie Kirk learned this the hard way. <!--1567411277739298816-->
* [ 7 September 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220908005837/https://twitter.com/SunSeekingPlant/status/1567678649322688517): The only kid I see is my 3 year old niece and I'm great at teaching her. She actually likes to learn- unlike these bums! <!--1567313046082576388-->

And then they constantly want you to help them with that thing. At that point I just let them suffer. <!--1567312231422988294-->

Being prudent and not wasting their potential. @TheOmniLiberal <!--1566818872476536837-->

Nick has always advocated for groypers to find solutions within the political system. This is why I support America First and turned away from the "alt right" and other violent ideologies. <!--1566807038662934534-->
