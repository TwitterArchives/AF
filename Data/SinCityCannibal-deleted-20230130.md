I would have never heard about you or Comfy, for example, if the site wasn't this bad and now that I know you, I see how unprofessional you are. It's not just Groypers, everyone's let down. <!--1569027403053420544-->

Worship, is, not, the, same, as, loving. No matter how much you love someone, it isn't the same as worship. <!--1567908826392985600-->

Worshipping something other than God is idolatry. That's pretty basic but understandable why an idiot like you would have a difficult time with it. <!--1567907661160804354-->

Mary is the dirt under someone's shoe, when you compare her to Christ who is God. She is a woman - misbegotten, faulty, defective, inferior and guilty of original sin - she deserves and should get little to no love. <!--1567905049799720960-->

The issue is who is the statue of and in this case they want the statue to be of Mary, a woman, which is unacceptable. Doesn't matter if she was the mother of Christ. <!--1567904406942941189-->

No, worship would be worship and loving would be loving, maybe you're a fucking idiot which is why you don't know that specific words have specific meanings. You're literally a fucking idiot. <!--1567902563206574081-->

They died so that their women could fuck other dudes while they were away. They fought for the right of their women to be whores and sluts. Veterans don't deserve respect, they deserve shit. <!--1567900222445223936-->

I have more of a problem with Catholics than the Catholic Church. As Mary is a woman - misbegotten, faulty, defective, inferior and guilty of original sin - she deserves and should get little to no love. https://twitter.com/burner56467366/status/1567891657630121986 <!--1567893050718040071-->

There's nothing more repulsive and disgusting than the unconditional love Mary gets compared to Christ. As if Mary, who's misbegotten, faulty, defective, inferior and guilty of original sin, is comparable to Christ who is God <!--1567873743866982403-->
* [ 8 September 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220908190617/https://twitter.com/SinCityCannibal/status/1567869625291120641): Holy shit, stop glorifying women. If it got replaced by a statue of Mary, I'd blow it up as well as the people who put it there. <!--1567869625291120641-->

Soon they'll be praising women for how brave they are for taking off their hijabs. This is a Muslim L. <!--1567815099192320000-->

She is inferior to you, she doesn't give you the permission to have sex with other women, you do it because you want to. Makes you look like a loser, desperate for her approval.
