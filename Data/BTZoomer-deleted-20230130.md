On the AF question: I'll simply refuse to not believe in America First, a component of which is moral revival. Calling it a cult ignores the reality that AF is organic and PASSES the test of logic when scrutinized. <!--1528129862342524934-->

Elon did what Trump did not, go DIRECTLY after the information networks. If he succeeds in this alone, it's over for our adversaries. Our adversaries RELY on information and narrative control. <!--1527728652573720577-->
