That's 10th grade, and I definitely thought of myself as someone with agency and free will. The AoC law exists to protect stupid girls who can't suss out predatory men, that's is why I support it.

A 15 year old was considered a young adult with agency 500 years ago, now we're supposed to treat them like children.

She wouldn't have been able to marry if the laws dictated you need to be 18 to be married. Clearly the age of consent law has nothing to do with a person's sexual maturity or their ability to marry. That's how it is a construct. <!--1404516745478430720-->

Essentially, once you're done with puberty, you're old enough to have sex. That's according to nature and how God designed it. AoC is a man-made law. <!--1404515754716766211-->
