The cops can be the idealized goody good superheros and the thieves can have actual character arcs. Unlike Ninja Steel (that show inspired me in all the wrong ways lol) it‚Äôs not shallow, it‚Äôs intentional characterization 18/24 <!--1505215740227600384-->

The last thing I‚Äôll say is that either they‚Äôd need to use the unmorphed costumes in original footage, or they‚Äôd need to recast those parts and idk how feasible that is for that many characters. They kept Torin/Zenowing in Dinocharge but he had minimal screen time <!--1476714531296403459-->

At the end of the day, those designs are SO crazy and ambitious that they can only do so much with them, and so they end up feeling lacking in some ways compared to the main Generations offerings- the trade off is aesthetics <!--1445866042098659329-->

I‚Äôve struggled with a similar thing, which is that G1 toys have a LOT of room for embellishment and improvement, but toys from the Beast Era on are much much closer to modern designs.

I‚Äôve seen similarities and differences that make it seem like instead of tweaking or reusing a design, they remolded some pieces and then fit them into a new design. <!--1438459931909296129-->

In SS they turned Jeep Bee into Cliffjumper, then into B-127. 3 toys with one core, two of them the same character <!--1438459252960550912-->

The focus on Autobots is so fierce that they reuse existing toys more than making new ones so they can feature the characters more often, since making new ones is more expensive and therefore limiting. We got more Sideswipes than Seekers! That‚Äôs bonkers! <!--1438458152366792704-->

The Seekers were brand new. Just being in both aesthetics doesn‚Äôt count. The point is that they did the same toys but with different cosmetics <!--1438324611867979777-->

It‚Äôs her transformation that lets me down, cuz the arms are simple and kinda messy. That would be fine on a retro toy, but on something modern it‚Äôs weird <!--1388594277438083074-->

Dinobot has a clever transformation that pulls off a great robot mode with a PERFECT head, but the beast mode is like 80% brick. It‚Äôs retro in a bad way <!--1388594275408035853-->

She turns into a spider that easily supports itself on its legs (always the downfall of arthropod toys back in the day), and somehow turns into a near-perfect Blackarachnia robot that can do the spider leg guns! <!--1388594273441001476-->

If you don‚Äôt do show-accurate beast modes, then there are 2 key areas left: do show-accurate robot modes, and make the beast modes more articulated <!--1388594271457091588-->

The area with the most potential is pulling off every mode with show accuracy, and that NEEDS the Masterpiece budget because it‚Äôs REALLY hard! <!--1388594267988369410-->

So if you‚Äôre going to bring Beast Wars ‚Äúup to date‚Äù, there‚Äôs significantly less room for improvement <!--1388594266306486272-->

I could just tell by looking at this toy that it was going to be good. If you love the character, I have a hunch you‚Äôll find SS ‚Äò86 Hot Rod even more satisfying than I do, at the very least in comparison with any other mainline Rodimus. <!--1359645150394343426-->

Siege Shockwave satisfied pretty much all the desire I‚Äôd have for a masterpiece version of the G1 design, and this Hot Rod hits that spot even better in every aspect. <!--1359645149257728004-->

My only experience with MP Hot Rod is Vangelus‚Äô review, and I have to say that SS ‚Äò86 Hot Rod looks sleeker and cleaner in both modes. <!--1359645147647066113-->

For me it‚Äôs totally worth that because you get extra polish and complexity that feels great in a smaller package, plus a robust accessory loadout. <!--1359645144555913220-->

And above all the transformation is really clever and fun; it‚Äôs a bit tricky to get the arms and legs lined up in car mode, but once they are it‚Äôs spot-on. <!--1359645141779312643-->

But beyond that, if both arguments are expressions of fatigue, then the question is: Where does the fatigue over characters like Elita-1 and Windblade come from? <!--1235391536696868866-->

It‚Äôs much easy to argue that HasTak should cool off on making Optimus and Rodimus toys and say that they ‚Äújust got one‚Äù recently, because they happen in such rapid succession. <!--1235390466423570432-->
