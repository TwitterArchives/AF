I think think the most amicable possibility is them ignoring each other. I don't forsee any bridges being built tbh. <!--1531480282766901248-->

He probably wants to walk it back, but there's no way that's happening. Basically total war has been declared. <!--1531475625961193472-->

By continuing after it was clearly debunked, they made themselves loose credibility. All of this gave Nick more justification to attack back even harder. <!--1531475019796299776-->

It was orchestrated by 80iq spergs and was easily debunked. By the BAP sphere amplifying it, they gave Nick the perfect excuse to strike back, while doing no real damage to him. <!--1531472670579204096-->

The BAP people just latched onto it as a way to kick him while he was down. Seems either they didn't expect a response and/or underestimated him. <!--1531471446253477889-->
